On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, you get bad information and the Keeper decides how that affects you. Spend your hold to: • have a useful object ready. • be somewhere you are needed, just in time. • take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to another hunter. • retroactively warn someone about an attack, so that it doesn’t happen.",

While you keep your oath and work towards your goal, mark experience at the end of every session and get +1 on any rolls that directly help achieve the goal. If you break the oath, take -1 ongoing until you have atoned.",
        "6": "Mentor: You have a mentor in the Sect: name them. When you contact your mentor for info, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you get an answer to your question, no problem. On a 7-9 you choose: they’re either busy and can’t help, or they answer the question but you owe a favour. On a miss, your question causes trouble.",
